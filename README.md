# The XBR Protocol

The XBR protocol, with "protocol" used in the context of the decentralized Internet, all things blockchain based, mainly consists of a set of smart contracts, programs to run on a blockchain that has a virtual machine to run programs, and a database to store data.

This repository contains the XBR smart contracts, with Ethereum as blockchain, and Solidity as implementation language for the XBR smart contracts.


## Development

Development is using the [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) Ethereum toolbelt, and the [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) Solidity smart contracts framework.
