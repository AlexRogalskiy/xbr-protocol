OpenZeppelin
============

`OpenZeppelin Solidity library <https://openzeppelin.org/>`_

.. note::

    Truffle comes standard with
    `npm integration <https://www.truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/package-management-via-npm>`_,
    and is aware of the node_modules directory in your project if it exists. This means you can use and
    distribute contracts, dapps and Ethereum-enabled libraries via npm, making your code available to others
    and other's code available to you.
