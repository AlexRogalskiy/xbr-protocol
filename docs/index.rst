The XBR Protocol
================

Welcome to XBR Protocol, the blockchain protocol for decentralized open data markets.

Here you find the reference documentation for the Ethereum/Solidity smart contracts
that make up the XBR Protocol and how to build applications that interface to XBR.

The XBR Protocol is Open-source (Apache 2.0 license), and you can find all the source
code on GitHub `here <https://github.com/xbr/xbr-protocol>`_.


.. warning::

    The XBR Protocol should be considered "experimental" at this stage, and the
    interfaces of the smart contracts will likely undergo some iterations before
    stabilizing. Use at your own risk, without any warranties whatsoever!
