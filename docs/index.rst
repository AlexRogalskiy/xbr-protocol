   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to The XBR Protocol's documentation!
============================================

.. note::

    The XBR protocol is documented primarily directly
    within source code using the
    `Natspec (Ethereum Natural Specification Format) <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format>`_
    and `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ is used to generate static HTML
    from the Solidity source code files.
