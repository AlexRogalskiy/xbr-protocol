The XBR Protocol
================

Welcome to XBR Protocol! Here you find the reference documentation for the Solidity smart contracts
that make up the XBR Protocol, and how to build applications that interface to those contracts.

.. warning::

    The XBR Protocol should be considered "experimental" at this stage, and the
    interfaces of the smart contracts will likely undergo some iterations before
    stabilizing. Use at your own risk, without any warranties whatsoever!
